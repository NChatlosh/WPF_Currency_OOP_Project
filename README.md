# WPF_Currency_OOP_Project
This project was a demo/exercise for organizing multiple projects/libraries and building a WPF app using the MVVM design pattern. This project originally began as a simple Currency Library that leverages Object Oriented principles to create a library of abstracted coin objects in two different types of currencies (US and UK) in the same hierarchy. These coins are managed by Currency Repo Objects, leveraging the Repository design pattern. I have also created an ASP .NET MVC version of this currency management demo leveraging the same Currency Library. That project is in a separate repo.
